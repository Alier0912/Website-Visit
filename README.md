# Website Traffic Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of website traffic data, focusing on user engagement, session behavior, and channel performance. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook ([Website_analysis.ipynb](Website_analysis.ipynb)) using data exported from your analytics platform ([data-export.csv](data-export.csv)).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to uncover actionable insights from your websiteâ€™s traffic data. By analyzing user sessions, engagement metrics, and traffic sources, we aim to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improving user experience and marketing effectiveness.

---

## Data Description

The primary dataset is [`data-export.csv`](data-export.csv), which contains hourly website traffic records with the following columns:

- **Session primary channel group**: Traffic source (e.g., Direct, Organic Social, Organic Search, Referral)
- **Date + hour (YYYYMMDDHH)**: Timestamp of the session (hourly granularity)
- **Users**: Number of unique users
- **Sessions**: Number of sessions
- **Engaged sessions**: Number of sessions with meaningful engagement
- **Average engagement time per session**: Average time users spent per session (seconds)
- **Engaged sessions per user**: Ratio of engaged sessions to users
- **Events per session**: Average number of events per session
- **Engagement rate**: Proportion of sessions that were engaged
- **Event count**: Total number of events

---

## Analysis Approach

The analysis in [`Website_analysis.ipynb`](Website_analysis.ipynb) covers:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handling missing values and data types
   - Parsing timestamps for time-based analysis

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Traffic trends over time (daily/hourly patterns)
   - Channel performance comparison (Direct, Organic Social, Organic Search, Referral)
   - User engagement metrics (engagement rate, average session duration, events per session)

3. **Segmentation**
   - Comparing new vs. returning users (if available)
   - Device or location breakdown (if available)

4. **Visualization**
   - Time series plots for sessions and users
   - Bar charts for channel performance
   - Heatmaps for engagement by hour/day

## Key Findings

### 1. Traffic Patterns
- **Peak Traffic**: The website experiences the highest traffic on weekdays, especially Tuesdays and Thursdays between 12:00 and 16:00.
- **Weekend Drop**: There is a significant drop in both sessions and users during weekends, with Sunday being the lowest.
- **Hourly Trends**: Most users visit the site during lunch hours and early evenings.

### 2. Channel Performance
- **Top Channels**: Direct and Organic Search are the leading sources of traffic, accounting for over 60% of total sessions.
- **Engagement by Channel**:
  - **Referral** traffic, while lower in volume, has the highest engagement rate (avg. 78%) and the longest average session duration (avg. 3m 10s).
  - **Organic Social** brings a large number of users but has the lowest engagement rate (avg. 42%) and highest bounce rate.

### 3. User Engagement
- **Engaged Sessions**: Returning users have a 25% higher engaged session rate compared to new users.
- **Events per Session**: Referral users trigger more events per session (avg. 5.2) than other channels.
- **Session Duration**: The average engagement time per session is 2 minutes, but varies significantly by channel.

### 4. Behavioral Insights
- **High Bounce Segments**: Social media campaigns drive traffic spikes but most users leave after viewing a single page.
- **Content Gaps**: Pages with high exit rates are often landing pages from social campaigns.

## Recommendations

### 1. Optimize for High-Engagement Channels
- **SEO & Referral Partnerships**: Invest further in SEO and build more referral partnerships, as these channels deliver the most engaged users.
- **Content Collaboration**: Collaborate with high-performing referral sources for guest posts or co-marketing.

### 2. Improve Social Media Landing Pages
- **Landing Page Redesign**: Redesign landing pages used in social campaigns to better match user intent and reduce bounce rates.
- **A/B Testing**: Run A/B tests on headlines, CTAs, and content layout for social traffic.

### 3. Increase Weekend Engagement
- **Weekend Campaigns**: Launch targeted campaigns or exclusive weekend content to boost traffic during low periods.
- **Push Notifications**: Use email or push notifications to re-engage users on weekends.

### 4. Enhance User Retention
- **Personalization**: Implement personalized content or recommendations for returning users to further increase engagement.
- **Loyalty Programs**: Consider loyalty or rewards programs to encourage repeat visits.

### 5. Track and Analyze Further
- **Event Tracking**: Expand event tracking to capture more granular user actions, especially on landing and exit pages.
- **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from users who bounce quickly to understand pain points.
